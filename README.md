# PsyDraft
Psychological documentation works in progress. The apps aspire to save time and support high quality clinical notes. Contributions welcome. PsyDraft is a modular, client-side diagnostic formulation engine designed for mental health professionals and researchers. It allows users to select symptoms across multiple DSM-5-TR diagnostic categories to generate cohesive, professional clinical narratives. The suite also include a SOAP note engine, and Treatment plan engine--Again--all very work in progress.

## Features

- Multi-Diagnosis Logic: Simultaneously select and formulate for co-morbid conditions.
- DSM-5-TR Congruence: Built-in logic gates for duration, symptom thresholds, and exclusion criteria.
- Modular Architecture: Easy to expand by adding new JavaScript modules to the project directory.
- Privacy-First: Operates entirely in the browser; no patient data is transmitted to an external server.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the directory structure includes the index.html file and the js folder containing the diagnostic modules.
3. Open index.html in any modern web browser.
4. Select the desired diagnoses in the left pane, check the applicable criteria in the middle, and copy the generated formulation from the right pane.
